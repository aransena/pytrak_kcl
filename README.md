# pytrak_kcl
Repo for code using pytrak with Ascension trakStar

You'll need to install the trakStar USB drivers before running this code. These are unsigned drivers so if you receive an error, and you're using Windows 8/10, you'll need to follow these instructions (use the advanced boot option) https://www.howtogeek.com/167723/how-to-disable-driver-signature-verification-on-64-bit-windows-8.1-so-that-you-can-install-unsigned-drivers/

There may be dependency issues, if you attempt to run trakstar_demo.py and it tells you that something is missing, let me know and I'll add a workaround to the readme.
